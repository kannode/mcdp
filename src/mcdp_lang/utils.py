    """
    Decorator for pyparsing parse actions to ease debugging.

    pyparsing uses trial & error to deduce the number of arguments a parse
    action accepts. Unfortunately any ``TypeError`` raised by a parse action
    confuses that mechanism.

    This decorator replaces the trial & error mechanism with one based on
    reflection. If the decorated function itself raises a ``TypeError`` then
    that exception is re-raised if the wrapper is called with less arguments
    than required. This makes sure that the actual ``TypeError`` bubbles up
    from the call to the parse action (instead of the one caused by pyparsing's
    trial & error).
